

this =>
	1. "this" refers to the current scope.
	2. "this" keyword is used for constructor chaining(calling one constructor of a class from another constructor of same class).
	3. "this" keyword is used to avoid shadowing of instance variables.

static =>

	1. static block
		a. It is called whenever a class is loaded onto the jvm for the first time.
		b. It is used to perform initial setting related to that class e.g. database connectivity, resource allocation.
		c. If a class has multiple static blocks then, they are executed in the same sequence as they are written inside the class.

	2. static instance variable
		a. For static instance variable of a class only one copy exists which is shared by all the objects.
		b. We can initialize the static instance variable inside the static block.

	3. static method
		a. Static method of a class can be called without object.
				ClassName.MethodName()
		b. Static method can access only static instance variables of a class.

	4. static import
		a. Static import will import only static things(static variables/methods) of a class.
		b. With static import we can call a static method even without a class name.

abstract -
		1. An abstract method is a method with only declaration and no definition.

		2. An abstract method has to be written only inside abstract class but, an abstract class can have abstract as well as
		   concrete methods

		3. An interface has all the methods declared as abstract by default. 

		4. A class cannot be extended from more than one class but it can implement more than one interface.

		5. One interface can extend another interface.

		6. Marker interface - It is an interface without any method inside that. e.g. Serializable, Cloneable

		7. Functional interface - It is an interface with only one method inside that. e.g. Runnable, Consumer, Predicate, Supplier

	       Internally uses dynamic array				Internally implemented as doubly linked list

HashSet - It is a collection of unique elements and order of insertion of elements is not preserved.

LinkedHashSet - It is a collection of unique elements and order of insertion of elements is preserved.

TreeSet - It is a collection of unique and sorted elements.

HashMap - It is a collection of unique elements and order of insertion of elements is not preserved. (Each element is a pair of key and value.)
